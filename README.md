Werewolf
========

A digital version of a classic game, known variably as Mafia and Werewolf

This repository contains the web service implementation for the game, currently deployed to [murmuring-cliffs-5802.herokuapp.com](murmuring-cliffs-5802.herokuapp.com).

In order to test the web service, please download and run `werewolfTests.py` (Python 3) in the `testScripts` folder.

The web service implements all of the essential functions as outlined in the project's requirements, and includes some extra HTTP requests for the purposes of a future web interface featuring an admin panel and/or signup page.
